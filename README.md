# AI Interview Chatbot

## Overview
This project is an Interview Chatbot created using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the Streamlit framework. The chatbot generates job-specific interview questions and evaluates the candidate's responses. This is achieved using a sequence of prompts that leverage the language model's capabilities in creating questions and evaluating responses.
